QPL (also qpl) is a General Purpose Programming Language written in C.



==============================================================================
** How To Build: **
==============================================================================
Currently there is a Shell Script called <build.sh>. You just need to make it
runable (f.e. '$ chmod u+x build.sh') and run it (f.e. '$ ./build.sh').
You need to have gcc, bison and flex installed on your system to build QPL.
