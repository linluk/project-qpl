QPL (also qpl) is a General Purpose Programming Language written in C.


==============================================================================
** How To Build: **
==============================================================================
Use the Makefile to build it. You Dont need to configure anything, just call
'make'. If succeeded its done.
You need to have gcc, bison and flex installed on your system to build QPL.
It compiles fine with these Versions:
  gcc 4.7.2 (Debian(4.7.2-5)
  bison 2.5
  flex 2.5.35
  glibc 2.13
On Debian GNU/Linux 7.7 (wheezy) 3.2.0-4-amd64.
If you experience Problems building the Application please add an issue on
<http://code.google.com/p/project-qpl/>.
