 datatypes implementation. see examples/datatypes.qpl.
   extend parser function calls to recognise method calls.
   add the caller to the callargs (something like create_call($3,create_callargs($5, $1)); )
   implement it in vm.c first add the params as usual, then set the instance like ( set_ast_to_id(inner, "self", <LAST_CALLARG>));
   be aware that in case of at_method callargs->count must be equal to params->count + 1!
   add create_instance() and create_datadef().
   implement builtin function new().

 implement a list datatype (builtin of course!). see examples/lists.qpl
