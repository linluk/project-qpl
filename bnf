 * brief   : defines the grammar of qpl
 *
 *
 * readme  : this is an bnf-style syntax description.
 *           names surrounded by "<" and ">" are non terminal symbols.
 *           non terminal symbols must be defined in this document.
 *           non terminal symbols may only contain letters ("a" - "z") and "-".
 *           the non terminal symbol on the left of a "::=" will be defined
 *           by a list of terminal and/or non terminal symbols on the right
 *           side of the "::=".
 *           a terminal symbol is an quoted c-style string.
 *           a list is a series of terminal and/or non terminal symbols
 *           seperated by "|" (without quotes).
 *           a list surrounded by "[" and "]" represents non or one of the
 *           elements in the list.
 *           a list surrounded by "[" and "]" followed by "+" represents one
 *           or more (arbitrary many) of the elements in the list.
 *           a list surrounded by "[" and "]" followed by "*" represents non,
 *           one or more (arbitrary many) of the elements in the list.
 *           a list surrounded by "(" and ")" or not surrounded by anything
 *           represents exactly one element in the list.
 *           empty lists (f.e. "[]", "[|]", "()", "(|)") are not allowed.
 *           every definition ends with a ";".
 *           comments are allowed everywhere except inside of non terminal or
 *           terminal symbols.
 *           comments are traditional c-style comments. a comment starts with
 *           "/" followed by "*" and ends with "*" followed by "/".
 *
 *
 * appendix: paranthesis:
 *             "(" and ")" are normaly not used in bnf, but i use them, here is
 *             why:
 *               it is not necasary to use "(" and ")". a not surrounded list 
 *               is exactly the same, but it is much more readable when
 *               parenthesis are used.
 *             for example:
 *               concatenation of either "a", "b" or "c" with either "x", "y"
 *               or "z" (--> "ax", "ay", "az", "bx", and so on):
 *               "a" | "b" | "c" "x" | "y" | "z"
 *               is the same as
 *               ("a" | "b" | "c") ("x" | "y" | "z")
 *               but i reccommend to use parenthesis to make it more readable.
 *             exception:
 *               the outher most list of an definition don't need parenthesis
 *               to be readable. here it is better not to use parenthesis.
 *               example:
 *                 <abc> ::= ( "a"
 *                         | "b"
 *                         | "c" )
 *                         ;
 *                 is the same as
 *                 <abc> ::= "a"
 *                         | "b"
 *                         | "c"
 *                         ;
 *
 *           styleguide:
 *             write every element of the outher most list of the definition
 *             in a seperate line. place the seperating "|" of the outher most
 *             list at the beginning of each line. start the line aligned to
 *             the "=" of the "::=". keep your lines shorter than 80 
 *             characters. if you have longer lines split them and indent them
 *             with 2 spaces. don't use tabs.
 *             align the trailing ";" of each definition under the "=" of the
 *             "::=".
 *
 *           if you make changes:
 *             add a short description containing the date and your name to
 *             the end of the "changes" section in this comment block.
 *
 *
 * changes : lukas singer 2015/01/03:
 *           changed some stuff to match the implemented grammar (pyrser.y)
